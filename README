Reason for making.

I lost the major card on my account, so when it got replaced I couldn't do netbanking exports of transactions any more.

So when it came to tax time, I was pretty screwed.

I can download pdf statements though, but don't fancy typing them all into skrooge, my accounting program.

cba2csv to the rescue.

-----

To use on ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install libpodofo-dev

copy one of your bank statments into the dir .. call it test.pdf

./run.sh

That will compile and run the converter.

You should now have a nice test.csv file in the dir.

----

to run on another pdf

./cba2csv /path/to/statement.pdf

----

to run on a directory of pdfs:

cp cba2csv /usr/bin/
find /path/to/statments -iname '*.pdf' -exec cba2csv {} \; -print
